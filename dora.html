            With his soft smile, he says,
            "Do not worry, Nobita… I am always here."
            And those words still reach every child watching —
            reminding us that it is okay to fail when someone believes in you.
            From his magical pocket come gadgets,
            but from his heart comes comfort, laughter, and hope.
            Doraemon does not just solve problems —
            he makes childhood feel safe, even today.
            And whenever life feels heavy,
            we still hear that familiar voice say,
            "It will be alright".
